/********************************************************************
 * Written by:
 *
 * Period:
 *
 * ASSIGNMENT:  To write a program that asks the user to input the
 * name of a datafile containing the outline of a figure. Then ask
 * for the row and column where the user would like to begin the
 * floodfill, use recursion to do the floodfill and then print the
 * final figure.  You will need:
 *
 * -  a fill method that asks the user for a file name and reads a
 * ‘shape’ from a data file into a 2D array of chars.
 *
 * -  a print method that asks the user for a starting point.
 * If the point is inside the shape, you should recursively
 * floodfill the shape. If the point is outside the shape the 2
 * ‘background’ should be floodfilled.  If the point is on a line
 * nothing should happen.  Error check the row & column to make
 * sure they are in the 2D array.
 * You should use a monospace font to print.
 * You can Consolas for pc's or Menlo for macs.
 *
 * -  a second print method that prints the floodfilled shape
 * and asks the user if (s)he would like to fill another shape.
 *

 * -  a recursive floodFill method that does the floodfill.
 *
 *
 * The data file will be in the form:
 *
 * 		#rows #cols
 * 		row col (for each point in shape)
 * 		row col
 * 		etc…
 *
 * your program should continue reading data files and floodfilling
 * until the user wants to quit.
