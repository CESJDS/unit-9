# Recursion
Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. 
## Requirements
[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and a compatible [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is required to run the files
## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:cesjds/unit-9.git
```
```
cd unit-9
```
```
idea .
```
## Usage
you can mess around with the functions and files in order to understand how the recursion methods work. 
## Plagarism
You are free to use any of the Worksheet classes in order to study towards the test. On the other hand, the FloodFill class is an individual project and you should not look or use my code in any shape or form.
