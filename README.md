# Recursion
Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. 
## Requirements
[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and a compatible [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is required to run the files
## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:cesjds/unit-9.git
```
```
cd unit-9
```
```
idea .
```
## Usage
you can mess around with the functions and files in order to understand how the recursion methods work.

This repository is not meant for you to directly or partly copy my work. It is meant to help you understand any part which you do not understand and for me to help you with your own program.
